Project Overview
üéì Student Performance Prediction using Linear Regression
This project predicts **student exam performance** based on their **weekly study hours** using a simple **Linear Regression model**.  
It also provides key evaluation metrics and visualizations to understand the model‚Äôs accuracy and data distribution.  

üìä Dataset
- The dataset used is: `student_performance_dataset.csv`  
- Features:
  - `Study_Hours_per_Week` ‚Üí Number of hours a student studies in a week  
  - `Final_Exam_Score` ‚Üí Final exam score of the student

 üöÄ Workflow
1. Load dataset  
2. Train a **Linear Regression** model  
3. Predict student exam scores  
4. Evaluate model performance using:
   - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)  
   - Mean Squared Error (MSE)  
   - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)  
   - R¬≤ Score (Model Accuracy)  
5. Visualize results:
   - Histogram of Final Exam Scores  
   - Scatter plot with Regression Line

 üìà Results
- Provides error metrics (MAE, MSE, RMSE, R¬≤)  
- Regression line shows relationship between study hours and exam performance  
- Example prediction:  
  > "Predicted Final Score for 9 Study Hours = 53.97785994%"
